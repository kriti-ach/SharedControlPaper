columns: 
  - condition:
      Description: Whether the trial is an AI-disengaged or AI-engaged trial within the AI block or a Non-AI trial in the Non-AI block
      Type: String
      Example: "Non-AI"
  - SSD:
      Description: The stop signal delay on that trial
      Type: float
      Example: "3.42"
  - block:
      Description: The practice or test phase of the experiment. Within the test phase, there are 'block 1' and 'block 2' which can be
      the AI block or the Non-AI block. If it's the AI block, the condition is either AI-disengaged or AI-engaged. And if it's the Non-AI
      block, the condition is always Non-AI
      Type: String
      Example: "block 1"
  - distances:
      Description: The distance of the center of the ball relative to the center of the ring at every timepoint in the trial. Each distance
      is operationalized as the ball's position at a timepoint minus the ring's position at that timepoint. Distances are in visual degrees
      where 1 cm =~ 1.154 visual degrees. 
      Type: String of floats
      Example: "[0.196, -0.196, ...]"
  - pressures:
      Description: The pressure applied on the spacebar at every timepoint in the trial. A pressure of 1 indicates that the subject is
      pressing the spacebar fully, and a pressure of 0 indicates that they aren't pressing the spacebar at all.
      Type: String of floats
      Example: "[1.0, 0.95, ...]"
  - time_stamps:
      Description: The time in seconds (s) at every timepoint in the trial. 
      Type: String of floats
      Example: "[0.58, 0.75, ...]"
