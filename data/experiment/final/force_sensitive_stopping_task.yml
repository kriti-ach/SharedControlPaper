columns: 
    - condition:
        Description: Whether the trial is an AI-failed or AI-assisted trial within the AI block or a Non-AI trial in the Non-AI block
        Type: String
        Example: " 'Non-AI' "
    - SSD:
        Description: The stop signal delay on that trial
        Type: float
        Example: "3.42"
    - block:
        Description: The practice or test phase of the experiment. Within the test phase, there are 'block 1' and 'block 2' which can be
        the AI block or the Non-AI block.
        Type: String
        Example: " 'block 1' "
    - relative_distance:
        Description: The distance of the center of the ball relative to the center of the ring at a given timepoint in the trial. Each distance
        is operationalized as the ball's position at a timepoint minus the ring's position at that timepoint. Distances are in visual degrees
        where 1 cm =~ 1.154 visual degrees. 
        Type: float
        Example: "-0.095"
    - distances:
        Description: The distance of the center of the ball on the screen at a given timepoint in the trial. 
        A distance of -15 signifies that the ball is at the starting position at the fixation cross. A distance of 15
        signifies that the edge of the ball is at the finish line. Distances are in visual degrees
        where 1 cm =~ 1.154 visual degrees. 
        Type: float
        Example: "-0.095"
    - pressures:
        Description: The pressure applied on the spacebar at every timepoint in the trial. A pressure of 1 indicates that the subject is
        pressing the spacebar fully, and a pressure of 0 indicates that they aren't pressing the spacebar at all.
        Type: flot
        Example: "1.0"
    - time_stamps:
        Description: The time in seconds (s) at every timepoint in the trial. 
        Type: float
        Example: "0.58"
    - sub_trial:
        Description: The subject number_trial number. Each trial spans multiple rows since the relative_distance, distances, pressures, 
        and time_stamps have many values across a trial .
        Type: String
        Example: " 's006_1' "
